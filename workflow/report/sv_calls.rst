SV calls plots allow to identify and analyse at the single-cell level, the SV detected in the pipeline

SV calls plot correspond to chromosome-wise plots summarizing all informations computed during the pipeline 
(count binning = orange/green core signal, grey/white background: mosaic segments, bottom green/yellow/orange line: W/C state, additional colors: SV groups).

Each different file corresponds to a different chromosome and each file presents a different track for each library processed successfully during the pipeline.
