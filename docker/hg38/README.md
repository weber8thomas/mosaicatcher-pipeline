# Docker image incl. hg38 reference genome

This is the same as `smei/mosaicatcher-pipeline` but including the reference 
genome *hg38*.


### Availability

* On [dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/smei/mosaicatcher-pipeline-hg38)

### Updates

This image is configured to auto-build on dockerhub. 

**Note**: Since the auto-build is triggered simultaneously with
`smei/mosaicatcher-pipeline` I don't think the most up-to-date version is utilized
as base image. If this should ever be an issue just re-build this image yourself.
